# Designing Route Guidance Mechanisms to Internalize Various Negative Externalities
Author: Keito Shiraki<br>

## Background
Recent navigation systems provide drivers with shortest-time or shortest-distance routes, but these routes are not always socially desirable. They may increase noise and vibration in residential areas, safety risks, road surface damage, and environmental burdens such as CO₂ emissions. Traditional route guidance systems do not sufficiently account for these externalities.

Meanwhile, advances in sensing and cocommunication technologies have enabled connected cars to collect high-frequency GPS and CAN data, capturing detailed driving behavior and traffic flow conditions. This creates new opportunities to quantify diverse externalities and evaluate routes from a social perspective.
Existing studies have revealed behavioral characteristic in route choice and proposed externality indicators, but they have not fully examined 
(1)the quantitative gap between individual-optimal and socially optimal routes
(2)mechanism design approaches to internalize externalities.
