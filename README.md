# Designing Route Guidance Mechanisms to Internalize Various Negative Externalities
Author: Keito Shiraki<br><br><br>

## Background
Recent navigation systems provide drivers with shortest-time or shortest-distance routes, but these routes are not always socially desirable. They may increase noise and vibration in residential areas, safety risks, road surface damage, and environmental burdens such as CO₂ emissions. Traditional route guidance systems do not sufficiently account for these externalities.

Meanwhile, advances in sensing and cocommunication technologies have enabled connected cars to collect high-frequency GPS and CAN data, capturing detailed driving behavior and traffic flow conditions. This creates new opportunities to quantify diverse externalities and evaluate routes from a social perspective.

Existing studies have revealed behavioral characteristic in route choice and proposed externality indicators, but they have not fully examined  
(1)the quantitative gap between individual-optimal and socially optimal routes  
(2)mechanism design approaches to internalize externalities.<br><br>

## Objectives
This study aims to:
- **Develop externality indicators**  
  -such as congestion, noise, safety risk, rosd surface damage, and CO₂ emissions.  
  -apply them to real GPS/CAN data from Higashi-hiroshima City.
- **Quantify the divergence between individual-optimal routes (User Equilibrium) and socially optimal routes that minimize total externalities**
- **Design mechanism-based strategies**  
  -including information provision, incentives, and nudges  
  -that encourage drivers to select socially desirable routes<br>

  Through these analyses, the study seeks to eplore how individual route choices can be guided toward system-optimal outcomes.
